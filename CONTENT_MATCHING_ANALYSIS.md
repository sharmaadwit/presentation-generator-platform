# Content Matching Analysis for Presentation Generator

## üéØ How Content Matching Works

The system uses a **two-tier approach** for finding relevant content:

### 1. **Trained Embeddings (Primary)**
- Uses vector similarity search on `slide_embeddings` table
- Searches by: `useCase + industry + customer` query
- Orders by `relevance_score DESC`
- Requires: `status IN ('approved', 'trained')`

### 2. **Approved Sources (Fallback)**
- Uses `presentation_sources` table when no embeddings available
- Searches by: `industry` and `tags`
- Requires: `status = 'approved'`

## üìä Current Database Structure

### Tables Used for Matching:
- **`slide_embeddings`**: Vector embeddings of slide content
- **`presentation_sources`**: Source presentations with metadata
- **`source_slides`**: Individual slides from sources

### Key Fields for Matching:
- **Industry**: `ps.industry` (exact match)
- **Tags**: `ps.tags` (array of keywords)
- **Content**: `se.content` (slide text content)
- **Relevance Score**: `se.relevance_score` (0.0-1.0)

## ‚úÖ User Inputs That WILL Find Matching Content

### **High Success Rate Scenarios:**

#### 1. **Exact Industry Match + Relevant Keywords**
