## ðŸš€ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Create Railway Project
- [ ] Go to Railway dashboard
- [ ] Click "New Project"
- [ ] Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
- [ ] Choose `presentation-generator-platform` repository
- [ ] Wait for Railway to detect services

### Step 2: Configure Services
Railway should automatically detect these services:
- [ ] **Frontend** (React app)
- [ ] **Backend** (Node.js API)
- [ ] **AI Service** (Python FastAPI)
- [ ] **PostgreSQL** (Database)

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables

#### Frontend Service:
- [ ] `REACT_APP_API_URL` = `https://your-backend-url.railway.app`
- [ ] `REACT_APP_AI_SERVICE_URL` = `https://your-ai-service-url.railway.app`

#### Backend Service:
- [ ] `NODE_ENV` = `production`
- [ ] `PORT` = `3001`
- [ ] `DATABASE_URL` = (provided by Railway PostgreSQL)
- [ ] `JWT_SECRET` = (generate secure 32+ character string)
- [ ] `OPENAI_API_KEY` = `sk-your-openai-api-key`
- [ ] `UPLOAD_DIR` = `/app/uploads`
- [ ] `CORS_ORIGIN` = `https://your-frontend-url.railway.app`
- [ ] `AI_SERVICE_URL` = `https://your-ai-service-url.railway.app`

#### AI Service:
- [ ] `OPENAI_API_KEY` = `sk-your-openai-api-key`
- [ ] `BACKEND_URL` = `https://your-backend-url.railway.app`
- [ ] `DATABASE_URL` = (same as backend)

#### PostgreSQL Service:
- [ ] `POSTGRES_DB` = `presentation_generator`
- [ ] `POSTGRES_USER` = `postgres`
- [ ] `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` = (generate secure password)

### Step 4: Deploy Services
- [ ] Click "Deploy" for each service
- [ ] Wait for all services to be "Live"
- [ ] Note down the generated URLs

### Step 5: Update Environment Variables
- [ ] Update `REACT_APP_API_URL` with actual backend URL
- [ ] Update `REACT_APP_AI_SERVICE_URL` with actual AI service URL
- [ ] Update `CORS_ORIGIN` with actual frontend URL
- [ ] Update `BACKEND_URL` with actual backend URL
- [ ] Redeploy services after URL updates

## ðŸ§ª Testing Checklist
