## üîß Technical Implementation

### Frontend Upload Component

The upload interface includes:

```typescript
// Upload form with drag & drop
<UploadManager>
  <FileUploader 
    accept=".pptx,.ppt,.pdf"
    maxSize="50MB"
    multiple={true}
  />
  <MetadataForm>
    <IndustrySelector />
    <TagInput />
    <DescriptionTextarea />
  </MetadataForm>
</UploadManager>
```

### Backend API Endpoints

```typescript
// Upload single presentation
POST /api/sources/upload
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

// Upload multiple presentations
POST /api/sources/upload/bulk
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

// Get upload status
GET /api/sources/upload/:uploadId/status

// Approve/reject source
PUT /api/sources/:sourceId/approve
```

### AI Processing Pipeline

```python
# 1. File validation and conversion
validate_file(file_path)
convert_to_pptx(file_path)  # if PDF

# 2. Slide extraction
extract_slides(presentation)

# 3. Content analysis
analyze_content(slides)

# 4. Indexing and storage
index_slides(slides, metadata)
```
